Unity-Free-Flight
=================

A Unity Package to add gliding flight to any Unity Object.

###Description

Have you ever wanted to create a game where you can fly over the precipitous mountainsides? Perhaps you want to show the world from a birds-eye perspective. Or, maybe your game has nothing to do with flight, you just want various birds to systematically poop on everything in a realistic fashion. Now you can!

Unity Free Flight aims to add a realistic layer of flight dynamics to Unity Objects. That is, you want something to fly? Add this script to the object, and now it can! 

It's true, there are plenty of flight simulators out there already. And maybe [they are what you're looking for](http://unityfs.chris-cheetham.com/). But most flight simulators are geared towards powered flight. That is, flying fighter jets or metal crafts. This Free Flight package is intended for slow moving craft, or winged creatures such as birds. Such objects are also at the [mercy of wind](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EV6dLtBJVFQ), [thermals](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV5w8EmqV5c)([what are those?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal)), or [thunder storm gust fronts](http://youtu.be/RkD4u6sW0LU?t=4m25s). 

Slow moving flight allows for some [incredible perspective](http://www.paraglidinghd.com/urban-side-paragliding/).

###Features

What does Unity Free Flight currently offer? **Nothing**. Unfortunately, this is a work of passion and not a paid project. However, if this interests you, you are welcome to fork what we have so far or [contact us](http://windwardproductions.org/contact/) at the [main website](http://windwardproductions.org/). Releases will be created as soon as there is enough functionality to warrant one. 

**Tip**: If I know people are interested, I'll be more motivated to create a release.
